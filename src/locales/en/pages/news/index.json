      "title": "What Is the Anterior Approach?",
      "text": "In a hip replacement, a surgeon replaces your worn-out hip joint with an artificial one to ease pain and improve movement. Traditionally, surgeons cut through big muscles in the back or side of your hip. The anterior approach, however, goes through the front. The surgeon moves muscles aside instead of cutting them, using special tools and a high-tech table called Hana®. This means: Less damage to your body, a smaller scar (just 3-4 inches), a smoother, quicker recovery."
